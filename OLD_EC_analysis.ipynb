    "# EC analysis with cellpose\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This analysis aims to normalise detected signal areas to the number of cells in the slice. To do this, machine learning model 'nuclei' from cellpose is used. It was tested and works pretty well, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the newest version of cellpose (cellpose 4) is no longer compatible the nuclei model and only 'cpasm' model downloads (which should handle everything). The problem is, that this model is too computationally heavy for computers without GPU (like mine). At one point I tested it on one image and it took over 20min (after that I interrupted the kernel as there is no point having script that takes that long). That is the reason why the cellpose this script uses is cellpose2.2.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- currently takes about ~1min per image\n",
    "\n",
    "- has problems with very nuclei-dense areas, but is nonetheless very accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "- the python version is also Python 3.10.18 (older from the base env.), because it's compatible with the version of cellpose this script uses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "- *DONE: script creates nuclei masks and saves them into a new folder, downstream analysis pulls on these saved masks (saves time in case of individual image corrections/re-working the script)*\n",
    "- *DONE: organoid mask is created based on the nuclei mask*\n",
    "- *DONE: figure out how to script where to assign the nuclei if they lay on any of the image borders (e.g. if >50% is in epicardium, the nuclei is in epicardium)*\n",
    "- *DONE: rewrite the script so that it records the area per number of nuclei*\n",
    "- *DONE(? - area is being recorded in the cell staging script): quality control - size of the nuclei is recorded and the info about average value/error bars is put into the script output*\n",
    "- *DONE: test of cell cycle staging - since I'm already recording the nuclei, I might as well test if I can identify cell cycle stage distribution in the organoid (secondary script output)*\n",
    "- *DONE: add option that if image name contains 5x, 10x, 20x, 40x (etc.) the pixel_size changes accordingly (with 10x likely being the default option)*\n",
    "- *DONE: make a new way to record masks*\n",
    "- *DONE: figure out the distances problem** - are the distances mathematical artifact of the script (proliferation would cause the distances to naturally decrease over time)*\n",
    "- *DONE: make a cutoff distance of ~20um - count the number of ECs that have a macrophage within that distance*\n",
    "- *DONE: to make the distances more accurate, figure out how to do the surface-to-surface thing... - either Euclidian distance transform, or surface dilation (since I don't need every single object, but only objects within a certain radius of the endothelial cell)*\n",
    "- *DONE (resp.gotten rid of): subepicardium border is a) renamed and b) dependent on the level of gaussian blurring(?)*\n",
    "- *DONE: border zone is erased since I don't use the blurring for 594/cTnT gating*\n",
    "- *DONE* add distances and EC analysis into a single script for better accuracy (no sense having 2 sets of parameters applied to a single image)\n",
    "- *DONE* make sure that when counting against the total number of nuclei its the total within the identified organoid area??? Since there are nuclei here and there that are left out... but the number is minimal <10 for d1... so it likely isn't necessary. Those are probably debri or really separated nuclei of macrophages that are too far from the organoid to be included\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Still TO-DO:\n",
    "\n",
    "- take care of the distances mask (currently makes thick outline of all ECs together, instead of individually)\n",
    "- make the fill_in_small_holes() scricter for 405 mask (there are many cavities that are counted in epicardium and shouldn't be)\n",
    "- also the thrash in the border region that is counted as EC is possibly messing up the distances\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle the 'division by zero' in area/nuclei calculations (what happens if there is no epi/myo? - put in try/except block?)\n"
